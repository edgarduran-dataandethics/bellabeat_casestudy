Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bellabeat Fitbit Case Study in R

The purpose of this case study was to showcase my use of R by doing nearly all stages of the process within the coding system. I learned R through the Google Analytics Certificate on Coursera and wanted to practice more with the platform. Note that this is a case study recieved through Google as an optional part of the Data Analytics certificate program. The prompt asks that I act as a junior analyst and hypothetically assist Bellabeat in adjusting their marketing strategy through the use of Fitbit data. The job was to look for trends within the data.

Fitbit data was retrieved from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

Inside you will find me going through these specific steps
* ASK: Where I state the business problem and the stakeholders
* PREPARE: Where I go through the beginning steps of setting up the workspace and how I went through exploring the data early on to decide what to work with.
* PROCESS: How I set up the data, cleaned it, and made it work for me.
* ANALYZE: The process I used to analyze and my thoughts behind it.
* RECOMMENDATIONS: Finally the recommendations I had based on the data and other research/experience.

This is my first case study and portfolio project. I am leaving it open to the possibility of using added data to further the analysis.
