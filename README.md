**Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bellabeat Fitbit Case Study in R**

The purpose of this case study was to showcase my use of an end-to-end data analysis using R, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and strategic recommendations. While the dataset is limited and provided only for practice, this case study demonstrates my ability to apply the data analysis process to a real-world inspired business scenario.

Fitbit data was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and was specifically used for practice purposes. The dataset includes activity, steps, and related fitness measures for over 30 users over a two-month period.

Inside you will find me going through these specific steps which were inspired by the six steps of the Google Data Analytics process
* ASK: Where I state the business problem and identify the stakeholders.
* PREPARE: Where I go through the beginning steps of setting up the R workspace. Additionally, it is an early high level exploration of the data to determine next steps in the anlysis and limitations.
* PROCESS: How I set up the data, cleaned it, and transformed it.
* ANALYZE: The process I used to analyze and my thoughts behind it.
* RECOMMENDATIONS: Finally, the recommendations I had based on the data and other research/experience.

**Business Questions to Answer:**
* What are some trends in smart device usage?
* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**Key Highlights**
* Conducted descriptive analysis of steps and activity patterns.
* Performed user segmentation (Above Average, Average, Below Average) aligned with suggested step guidelines.
* Explored consistency and variability in user behavior using standard deviation.
* Examined correlation between steps and sedentary time.
* Developed strategic recommendations including gamification, consistency rewards, inclusivity in marketing, and health-based messaging.

**Notes**
* This dataset is small and non-representative, but it was valuable for practicing an end-to-end analysis workflow.  
* I learned R through the Google Analytics Certificate on Coursera and created this project to deepen my applied skills.  
* This is my first case study and portfolio project using R. In the future, I may expand this analysis with additional datasets or comparative methods.  
* This README is written for portfolio reviewers and hiring managers; see the Executive Summary (PDF) for a stakeholder-facing version.
